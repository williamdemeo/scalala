This repository collects some Scala programs for research in Universal Algebra and Lattice Theory.

As of March 2016 there's nothing fancy in here yet.  The only "real" working code is pretty ugly and
was coded in a hury to search for some example of algebras that are of interest to our research
project (see, e.g., CIB.scala, and
[this README.md file](https://github.com/UACalc/AlgebraFiles/tree/master/Bergman) for more details).
There are also some files here containing code that was merely for getting my feet wet/hands dirty
with Scala.

Comments/questions/suggestions are welcomed.  If you have any, please
[open a new issue](https://github.com/williamdemeo/scalala/issues/new).

To use this code (optionally fork and then) clone the repository to your local drive.
Enter the scalala directory and type `./sbt` at the command line. At the sbt prompt,
enter `compile`.

Optionally, at the sbt prompt, after the compile command, enter `eclipse` to setup a project
suitable for importing into the Eclipse IDE. Then, in Eclipse, select the following menu options:

    File -> Import -> Projects from Git -> local repository -> ... etc.
